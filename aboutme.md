# Few things about me
My name is Sanadhi Sutandi, a neophile wanna-be and a lazy bum. My full name is available online but I don't feel like it shouldn't be mentioned here.
If you happen to figure out my fullname, here's a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_name) to broaden a little bit of your knowledge :).
I am used to be called "**Sanadhi**" but honestly I prefer people to call me by the shortest version of my nickname, "**Adhi**".

I am a Chinese-descendant Balinese. I was born and raised in Bali and my family still holds some chinese traditions in our daily life.
Despite the fact that my family does not speak Chinese (with exception of my father being able to speak [Hainanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan) and understand a little bit of Mandarin), I do informally have a Chinese name.

I would be happy to be considered as **a Balinese, Chinese-Balinese, [Chinese-Indonesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Indonesians), or an Indonesian.**

# My professional journey
