After restructuring my website 3 times, from github pages to AWS EC2 and back again to github pages, I've decided to start blogging again.
The thought has come to me all the time. However, as usual I was being super lazy and unmotivated enough.

In any case, I believe I have passed (hopefully) my quarter-life crisis and I am in much better shape now.
Given that life is not all about obtaining something, I would love to share my opinions, ideas, and experiences to everyone!

I am willing to publish one/two posts monthly.
Let's hope that I am not going to procrastinate writing future posts :p
